### Steps

1. **Install Python 3.11**

   - Note: It is recommended to install with administrator privileges.
   - Note 2: This script does not support conda environments well, it is advised not to use conda environments.

2. **Run act_ws.py or uac_start.cmd**
   - Double-click `act_ws.py` or `uac_start.cmd` to run. If there are no issues, a cmd window will pop up indicating that ACT has been successfully installed.
